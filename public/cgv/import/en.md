Article 1 – Purpose of the mandate
MYG Import by Car Spark Import (the “Agent”) is mandated by the Client to search for, purchase and organise the export of a vehicle from Japan to Europe, including logistics and administrative support as described in this document. The Agent acts in the Client’s interest with transparency and professionalism.

Article 2 – Fees in Japan
Japanese auction and local handling fees are standardized and invoiced at cost by our local partner. As an indication: a fixed fee of ¥90,000 applies, plus 5% on the portion exceeding ¥1,000,000. These amounts, when applicable, are re‑invoiced without margin and supported by source documents. Local inland transport (auction site to port) is billed according to distance.

Article 3 – Obligations of the Agent
The Agent undertakes to: (i) conduct a diligent search in Japan matching the Client’s criteria, (ii) verify available information and provide inspection elements where possible, (iii) organise export formalities and sea shipment, and (iv) keep the Client informed at key milestones. The Agent acts with care but cannot guarantee elements outside its control (e.g. third‑party timings, shipping schedules).

Article 4 – Obligations of the Principal (Client)
The Client undertakes to: (i) provide accurate selection criteria and identification details, (ii) make payments within the agreed timelines, (iii) promptly supply any documents required for export or subsequent registration, and (iv) comply with the import and registration rules applicable in the destination country.

Article 5 – Legal guarantee of conformity and commercial warranty
The legal framework, possible guarantees and after‑sales coverage depend on the vehicle’s status, age and destination country rules. Where an additional commercial warranty is available, its terms and perimeter will be specified in the quote or mandate. This article does not limit mandatory consumer rights where applicable.

Article 6 – Term of the mandate
The mandate takes effect on the date of signature and remains valid for the period indicated in the quote/mandate. It may be renewed by mutual agreement or terminated according to the conditions below. Operations already engaged (bids, purchases, shipments) remain due.

Article 7 – Agent’s remuneration
The Agent’s remuneration (commission or package) and any option(s) selected are specified in the quote/mandate accepted by the Client. Unless otherwise stated, stated prices include VAT where applicable in Luxembourg. Any additional services requested by the Client will be quoted separately.

Article 8 – Payment terms
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payments are due within 3 to 7 calendar days after purchase in Japan for the vehicle and fees due at that stage. Sea freight, customs duties, VAT and remaining balances are payable according to the schedule indicated in the quote/mandate. Bank transfer is the standard method of payment.

Article 9 – Right of withdrawal
If consumer withdrawal rights apply, they are exercised in accordance with the legal framework and within the statutory period. The Client acknowledges that certain services (e.g. auctions, specific orders, shipping already engaged) may limit or exclude withdrawal in accordance with applicable law. Practical details are recalled in the quote/mandate.

Article 10 – Miscellaneous
Applicable law and competent jurisdiction are specified in the quote/mandate. In case of discrepancy between language versions, the French version may prevail for legal interpretation unless otherwise agreed. The Parties will prioritise amicable resolution before any formal proceedings.
